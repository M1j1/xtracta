Hi there,

To run this example, just spin it up on any php/apache server. It does not use any databases or any special plugins etc, so it should 
be fine with vanilla PHP.

The test provided a supplier file with just over 90 records, but for fun I increased the supplier records to 300,000.
The script runs fairly ok on my test machine, 70% of the time to execute is in reading and processing the suppliers. 
This could easily be reduced by using caching and other techniques.
(To run the test suppliernames.txt file, please edit the /tasks/read_suppliers.php file)

If you have any issue running the code please feel free to ring/email any time of the day.

Thank you for your time.
